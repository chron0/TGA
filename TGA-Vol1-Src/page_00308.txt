298 | THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO

would have told me ten times as much as they did. But this, too,
provides food for thought. If both the courts and the prosecutor‘s
office were simply pawns of the Minister of State Security, then
maybe there isn‘t any need for a separate chapter to describe them.

They vied with each other in telling me things, and I kept
looking around me in astonishment. They were people! Real
people! They were smiling! They were explaining that their
intentions were of the best. Well, and what if things turn full
circle and it is once again up to them to try me? Maybe even in
that very hall—and they were showing me the main hall.

Well, so they will convict me.

Which comes, first—the chicken or the egg? The people or
the system?

For several centuries we had a proverb: "Don‘t fear the law,
fear the judge."

But, in my opinion, the law has outstripped people, and people
have lagged behind in cruelty. It is time to reverse the proverb:
"Don‘t fear the judge, fear the law."

They stepped onto the rostrum and talked about Ivan Deniso—
vich. They said happily that the book had eased their consciences
(that‘s what they said . . .). They admitted that the picture I
painted was decidedly on the bright side, that every one of them
knew of camps worse than that. (Ah, so they did know?) Of the
seventy people seated around that horseshoe, several turned out
to be knowledgeable in literature, even to be readers of Novy
Mir. They were eager for reform. They spoke forcefully about
our social ulcers, about our neglect of our rural areas.

And I sat there and thought: If the first tiny droplet of truth
has exploded like a psychological bomb, what then will happen in
our country when whole waterfalls of Truth burst forth?

And they will burst forth. It has to happen.
