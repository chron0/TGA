think of trying to escape, so that for a long time he wouldn‘t
notice his new advantage: the fact that he had exchanged a stone—
walled prison for a railroad car with thin plank walls.

But in order to load one thousand prisoners into railroad cars
at night so precisely, the prison had to start jerking them out of
their cells and processing them for transport the morning before,
and the convoy had to spend the entire day on a long—drawn—out
and strict procedure of checking them in while still in prison and
then holding those who‘d been checked in for long hours, not, of
course, in the cells by now, but in the courtyard, on the ground,
so as not to mix them up with the prisoners still belonging in
the prison. Thus for the prisoner the loading at night was only a
relief after a whole day of torment.

Besides the ordinary counts, verifications, hair clipping, cloth—
ing roasting, and baths, the core of the preparation for the pri—
soner transport was general frisking. This search was carried
out not by the prison but by the convoy receiving the prisoners.
The convoy was expected, in accordance with the directives re—
garding the red transports and in accordance with their own
operational requirements, to carry out this search so that the
prisoners would not be left in possession of anything that might
help them to escape; to take away: everything that could saw
or cut; all powders (tooth powder, sugar, salt, tobacco, tea) so
they could not be used to blind the convoy; all string, cord, twine,
belts, and straps because they could all be used in escaping (and
that meant all kinds of straps! and so they cut off the straps which
held up the artificial limb of a one—legged man—and the cripple
had to carry his artificial leg on his shoulder and hop with the
help of those on either side of him). The rest of the things—all
"valuables" and suitcases too—were, according to instructions,
supposed to be checked and carried in a special baggage car and
returned to their owners at the end of the journey.

Yet the power of the Moscow directive was weak and might
be ignored by the Vologda or the Kuibyshev convoy, while the
power of the convoy over the prisoners was very corporeal, very
real. And this fact was crucial to the third objective of the load—
ing operation:

e in simple justice to take all the good things they possess
from enemies of the people for the use of its sons
