cut off and estranged from everything, wrote a song, and before
twilight sang it in their uncertain voices:

Three times a day we go for gruel,
The evenings we pass in song,

With a contraband prison needle

We sew ourselves bags for the road.

We don‘t care about ourselves any more,
We signed—just to be quicker!

And when will we ever return here again
From the distant Siberian camps?

Good Lord, how could we have missed the main point of the
whole thing? While we had been plowing through the mud out
there on the bridgeheads, while we had been cowering in shell
holes and pushing binocular periscopes above the bushes, back
home a new generation had grown up and gotten moving. But
hadn‘t it started moving in another direction? In a direction we
wouldn‘t have been able and wouldn‘t have dared to move in?
They weren‘t brought up the way we were. .

Our generation would return—having turned in its weapons,
jingling its heroes‘ medals, proudly telling its combat stories. And
our younger brothers would only look at us contemptuously:
Oh, you stupid dolts!
