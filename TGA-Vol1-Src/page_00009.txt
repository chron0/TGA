Preface | xi

This book could never have been created by one person alone.
In addition to what I myself was able to take away from the
Archipelago—on the skin of my back, and with my eyes and ears
—material for this book was given me in reports, memoirs, and
letters by 227 witnesses, whose names were to have been listed
here.

What I here express to them is not personal gratitude, because
this is our common, collective monument to all those who were
tortured and murdered.

From among them I would like to single out in particular those
who worked hard to help me obtain supporting bibliographical
material from books to be found in contemporary libraries or
from books long since removed from libraries and destroyed;
great persistence was often required to find even one copy which
had been preserved. Even more would I like to pay tribute to
those who helped me keep this manuscript concealed in difficult
periods and then to have it copied.

But the time has not yet come when I dare name them.

The old Solovetsky Islands prisoner Dmitri Petrovich Vitkov—
sky was to have been editor of this book. But his half a lifetime
spent there—indeed, his own camp memoirs are entitled "Half
a Lifetime"—resulted in untimely paralysis, and it was not until
after he had already been deprived of the gift of speech that he
was able to read several completed chapters only and see for
himself that everything will be told.
