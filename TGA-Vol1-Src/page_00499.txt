The Ships
of the Archipelago

Scattered from the Bering Strait almost to the Bosporus are
thousands of islands of the spellbound Archipelago. They are
invisible, but they exist. And the invisible slaves of the Archipel—
ago, who have substance, weight, and volume, have to be trans—
ported from island to island just as invisibly and uninterruptedly.

And by what means are they to be transported? On what?

Great ports exist for this purpose—transit prisons; and smaller
ports—camp transit points. Sealed steel ships also exist: railroad
cars especially christened zak cars ("prisoner cars"). And out
at the anchorages, they are met by similarly sealed, versatile
Black Marias rather than by sloops and cutters. The zak cars
move along on regular schedules. And, whenever necessary,
whole caravans—trains of red cattle cars—are sent from port to
port along the routes of the Archipelago.

All this is a thoroughly developed system! It was created over
dozens of years—not hastily. Well—fed, uniformed, unhurried
people created it. The Kineshma convoy waits at the Moscow
Northern Station at 1700 hours on odd—numbered days to accept
Black Marias from the Butyrki, Krasnaya Presnya, and Taganka
prisons. The Ivanovo convoy has to arrive at the station at 0600
hours on even—numbered days to receive and hold in custody
transit prisoners for Nerekhta, Bezhetsk, and Bologoye.

All this is happening right next to you, you can almost touch
