278 | THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO

in my life? I would have liked to feel nervous, to experience this
moment to the full, but I just couldn‘t. And the major had al—
ready pushed the sheet over to me, the blank side facing up.
And a schoolchild‘s seven—kopeck pen, with a bad point that had
lint on it from the inkwell, lay there in front of me.

"No, I have to read it myself."

"Do you really think I would deceive you?" the major objected
lazily. "Well, go ahead, read it."

Unwillingly, he let the paper out of his hand. I turned it over
and began to look through it with deliberate slowness, not just
word by word but letter by letter. It had been typed, but what I
had in front of me was not the original but a carbon:

EXTRACT
from a decree of the OSO of the NKVD of the U.S.S.R.
of July 7, 1945,‘ No. .

 

All of this was underscored with a dotted line and the sheet was
vertically divided with a dotted line:

Case heard: . Decreed:
Accusation of so—and—so . _ To designate for so—and—so (name)
(name, year of birth, . _ for anti—Soviet propaganda, and for
place of birth) . _ an attempt to create an anti—Soviet

organization, 8 (eight) years in
corrective labor camps.

Copy verified. Secretary

Was I really just supposed to sign and leave in silence? I looked
at the major—to see whether he intended to say something to me,
whether he might not provide some clarification. No, he had no
such intention. He had already nodded to the jailer at the door to
get the next prisoner ready.

To give the moment at least a little importance, I asked him,
with a tragic expression: "But, really, this is terrible! Eight years!
What for?"

And I could hear how false my own words sounded. Neither he
nor I detected anything terrible.

"Right there." The major showed me once again where to sign.

I signed. I could simply not think of anything else to do.

1. They had met to sentence me on the very day of the ammesty. The work
must go on. .
