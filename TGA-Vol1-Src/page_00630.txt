620 | TRANSLATOR‘s NOTES

office work, as hospital orderlies, as cooks, bread cutters, assis—
tants in the mess hall, etc., etc.—and thereby were in a better
position to survive. These latter were contemptuously christened
by the other prisoners "pridirki"—derived from a verb meaning
to shirk general—assignment work. I have here translated "pri—
durki" as "trusties." As in many other cases there is no exact
English equivalent, but this is certainly as close as there is.

Anyone who wishes to delve further into the lingo of Russian
thieves and camps can well make use of the valuable book Soviet
Prison Camp Speech, a Survivor‘s Glossary, compiled by Meyer
Galler and Harlan E. Marquess, University of Wisconsin Press,
1972.

I wish to thank those who have given me invaluable assistance
with this translation—and in the first place and in particular
Frances Lindley, my experienced, able, and long—suffering editor
at Harper & Row; Dick Passmore, my brilliant copy editor;
Theodore Shabad, who has labored long and industriously over
the glossary and details in footnotes and text; and also Nina
Sobolev, for her long faithful hours of help of all kinds.

Michael Scammell, the well—known British translator and edi—
tor, was kind enough to come to New York during the final stages—
of the preparation of this manuscript and provide the benefit of
his own considerable experience in giving the text one last thor—
ough and most useful going over. I am deeply grateful to him.

There are several others who have done more for this project
than I can possibly thank them for. But I can at least try—in the
knowledge that they will know whom I mean when they read
these lines.

Yet with all this, if there are faults in this translation, as no
doubt there are, mine is the responsibility.

T.P.W.
