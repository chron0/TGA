228 | THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO

And so it went. We‘talked about all kinds of things and recalled
something amusing, and it was all very jolly and delightful to be
among interesting people who were so different from those you
used to spend your life with, and who came from outside your
own circle of experience. Meanwhile the silent evening check—up
had come and gone, and they had taken eyeglasses away and the
light bulb had blinked three times. That meant that bedtime would
be in five minutes.

Quick! Quick! Grab a blanket! Just as you never knew at the
front when a hail of shells would begin to fall all around you,
here you didn‘t know which would be your fateful interrogation
night. And we would lie down with one arm on top of the blanket
and try to expel the whirlwind of thought from our heads. Go

Name with ‘Z‘?" But the guard did not whisper anything. The
door closed. We raised our heads. There was a newcomer at the
door: on the thin side, young, in a cheap blue suit and a dark—blue

"Fifty—three."

He shuddered a bit.

"Are you from freedom?" we asked.

"No!" He shook his head in a painful sort of way.

"When were you arrested?"

"Yesterday morning."

We roared. He had a very gentle, innocent sort of face, and
his eyebrows were nearly white.

"What for?"

(It was an unfair question. One could not really expect an
answer. )

"Oh, I don‘t know. . . . Nothing much."

That was how they all replied. Everyone here was imprisoned
because of nothing much. And to the newly arrested prisoner his
own case always seemed especially nothing much.

"But anyway, what was it?"
