have the right to repress others. In keeping silent about evil, in
burying it so deep within us that no sign of it appears on the
surface, we are implanting it, and it will rise up a thousandfold
in the future. When we neither punish nor reproach evildoers, we
are not simply protecting their trivial old age, we are thereby
ripping the foundations of justice from beneath new generations.
It is for this reason, and not because of the "weakness of indocâ€”
trinational work," that they are growing up "indifferent." Young
people are acquiring the conviction that foul deeds are never
punished on earth, that they always bring prosperity.

It is going to be uncomfortable, horrible, to live in such a
country!
