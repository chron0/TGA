564 | THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO

one ever does anything out of the generosity of his heart. You
have to pay for everything. If someone proposes something to
you that is unselfish, disinterested, you can be sure it‘s a dirty
trick, a provocation. The main thing is: avoid general—assignment
work. Avoid it from the day you arrive. If you land in general—
assignment work that first day, then you are lost, and this time
for keeps."

"General—assignment work?"

"General—assignment work—that is the main and basic work
performed in any given camp. Eighty percent of the prisoners
work at it, and they all die off. All. And then they bring new ones
in to take their places and they again are sent to general—assign—
ment work. Doing this work, you expend the last of your strength.
And you are always hungry. And always wet. And shoeless. And
you are given short rations and short everything else. And put in
the worst barracks. And they won‘t give you any treatment when
you‘re ill. The only ones who survive in camps are those who
try at any price not to be put on general—assignment work. From
the first day."

"At any price?"

"At any price!"

At Krasnaya Presnya I assimilated and accepted this alto—
gether unexaggerated advice of the cruel special—assignment pris—
oner, forgetting only to ask him one thing: How do you measure
that price? How high do you go?
