Translator‘s Notes

These translator‘s notes are not intended to overlap the exten—
sive explanatory and reference material contained in the author‘s
own notes in the text and in the glossary which follows. They
attempt to give that minimum of factual material about this book
and the whole work of which it is a part which will enable the
reader better to put it in perspective and understand what it is,
and also to deal with several areas of special Russian terminology.

The glossary which follows these notes can be very useful. It
gives in alphabetical order capsule identification of persons, in—
stitutions and their acronyms, political movements, and events
mentioned in the text.

The title of the book in Russian—Arkhipelag GULag—has a
resonance resulting from a rhyme which cannot be rendered in
English.

The image evoked by this title is that of one far—flung "country"
with millions of "natives," consisting of an archipelago of islands,
some as tiny as a detention cell in a railway station and others as
vast as a large Western European country, contained within
another country—the U.S.S.R. This archipelago is made up of
the enormous network of penal institutions and all the rest of the
web of machinery for police oppression and terror imposed
throughout the author‘s period of reference on all Soviet life.
Gulag is the acronym for the Chief Administration of Corrective
Labor Camps which supervised the larger part of this system.
