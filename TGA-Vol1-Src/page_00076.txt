word "appeal" could mean personal advice. And we say "could

any idea which did not coincide with or rise to the level of
intensity of the ideas expressed in the newspaper on any par—
ticular day. After all, anything which does not strengthen must
weaken: Indeed, anything which does not completely fit in,
coincide, subverts!

preceding ones: if the action was undertaken by an organization
or if the criminal joined an‘organization.

In actual practice, the section was so broadened that no
organization whatever was required. I myself experienced the
subtle application of this section. T‘wo of us had secretly ex—
