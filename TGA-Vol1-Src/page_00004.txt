Author‘s Note

For years I have with reluctant heart withheld from publication
this already completed book: my obligation to those still living
outweighed my obligation to the dead. But now that State Se—
curity has seized the book anyway, I have no alternative but to
publish it immediately.

In this book there are no fictitious persons, nor fictitious events.
People and places are named with their own names. If they are
identified by initials instead of names, it is for personal considera—
tions. If they are not named at all, it is only because human
memory has failed to preserve their names. But it all took place
just as it is here described.
