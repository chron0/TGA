The Interrogation | 143

tell anyone about the methods used in conducting my interroga—
tion. (No one knows, incidentally, what article of the Code this
comes under.)

In several of the provincial administrations of the NKVD this
measure was carried out in sequence: the typed statement on
nondisclosure was shoved at a prisoner along with the verdict
of the OSO. And later a similar document was shoved at prison—
ers being released from camp, whereby they guaranteed never
to disclose to anyone the state of affairs in camp.

And so? Our habit of obedience, our bent (or broken) back—
bone, did not suffer us either to reject this gangster method of
burying loose ends or even to be enraged by it.

We have lost the measure of freedom. We have no means of
determining where it begins and where it ends. We are an Asiatic
people. On and on and on they go, taking from us those endless
pledges of nondisclosure—everyone not too lazy to ask for them.

By now we are even unsure whether we have the right to talk
about the events of our own lives.
