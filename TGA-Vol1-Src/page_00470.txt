them political isolators—political detention centers—demonstrat—
ing with this phrase their view of the members of once revolution—
ary parties as political enemies and stressing not the punitive role
of the bars but only the necessity of isolating (and only tempor—
arily, it appeared) these old—fashioned revolutionaries from the
onward march of the new society. So that was how the arches of
the old central prisons (evidently including the one in Suzdal
from the very beginning of the Civil War) came to receive SR‘s,
Social Democrats, and Anarchists.

They all returned to prison with a consciousness of their rights
as convicts and a long—established tradition of how to stand up
for them. They accepted as their legal due a special political
ration (conceded by the Tsar and confirmed by the Revolution),
which included half a pack of cigarettes a day; purchases from the
market (cottage cheese, milk) ; unrestricted walks outdoors during
most hours of the day; being addressed with the formal personal
pronoun by prison personnel and not having to stand up when
addressed by them; confinement of husband and wife in the same
cell; the right to have newspapers, magazines, books, writing
materials, and personal articles, even including razors and scissors;
sending and receiving letters three times a month; visits from rela—
tives once a month; windows without bars, of course (at that time
the concept of the "muzzle" did not exist) ; unrestricted visits from
cell to cell; courtyards with greenery and lilacs for outdoor walks;
the freedom to choose companions for outdoor walks and to toss
small mailbags from one courtyard to another; and the dispatching
of pregnant women from prison into exile two months before they
were due to give birth."

All this was just the politregime—the prison regimen for po—
litical prisoners. But the political prisoners of the twenties re—
membered well something even more important: self—government
for political prisoners, and hence even in prison the sense of one—
self as part of a whole, a member of a community. Self—govern—
ment (the free election of spokesmen who represented all the
interests of all the prisoners in negotiations with the prison ad—
ministration) weakened the pressure on the individual because all
shoulders bore it together; and it augmented each protest because
all voices spoke as one.

7. From 1918 on, they did not hesitate to imprison women SR‘s, even when
they were pregnant.
