all over with human feces, so densely scattered over the whole
square that it was difficult to find a spot to place one‘s two feet
and squat. However, we spread ourselves about and the five of us
did squat down. Two machine gunners grimly pointed their
machine pistols at us as we squatted, and before a minute had
passed the master sergeant brusquely urged us on:

"Come on, hurry it up! With us they do it quickly!"

Not far from me squatted one of the tankmen, a native of
Rostov, a tall, melancholy senior lieutenant. His face was
blackened by a thin film of metallic dust or smoke, but the big
red scar stretching across his cheek stood out nonetheless.

"What do you mean, with us?" he asked quietly, indicating no
intention of hurrying back to the punishment cell that still stank
of kerosene.

"In SMERSH counterintelligence!" the master sergeant shot
back proudly and more resonantly than was called for. (The
counterintelligence men used to love that tastelessly concocted
word "SMERSH," manufactured from the initial syllables of the
words for "death to spies." They felt it intimidated people.)

"And with us we do it slowly," replied the senior lieutenant
thoughtfully. His helmet was pulled back, uncovering his still
untrimmed hair. His oaken, battle—hardened rear end was lifted
toward the pleasant coolish breeze.

"Where do you mean, with us?" the master sergeant barked at
him more loudly than he needed to.

"In the Red Army," the senior Hieutenant replied very quietly
from his heels, measuring with his look the cannon—tailer that
never was. |

Such were my first gulps of prison air.
