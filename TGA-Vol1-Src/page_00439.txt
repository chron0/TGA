"How can that be?"

"I was in the witnesses‘ room and I didn‘t hear what was said
in here."

"You don‘t have to hear! Many documents passed through
your hands. You couldn‘t help but know."

"The documents were all in proper order."

"But here is a stack of district newspapers, and even there they
were writing about Vlasov‘s wrecking activities. And you claim
you don‘t know anything?"

"Well, go ask the people who wrote the articles."

Then there was the manager of the bread store.

"Tell me, does the Soviet government have much bread?"

(Well, now! Just how could you answer that? Who was going
to say: "I didn‘t count it"?)

"A lot."

"Why are there bread lines at your store?"

"I don‘t know."

"Who was in charge?"

"I don‘t know."

"What do you mean, you don‘t know? Who was in charge of
your store?"

"Vasily Grigoryevich."

"What the devil! What do you mean calling him Vasily Gri—
goryevich? Defendant Vlasov! That means he was in charge."

The witness fell silent.

The judge of the court dictated to the stenographer: "The
answer: ‘As a consequence of the wrecking activity of Vlasov,
bread lines resulted, notwithstanding the Soviet government‘s
enormous stocks of bread.‘"

Repressing his own fears, the prosecutor delivered a long and
angry speech. The defense lawyer for the most part defended only
himself, emphasizing that the interests of the Motherland were
as dear to him as they were to any honest citizen.

In his final words to the court, Smirnov asked for nothing and
expressed no repentance for anything. Insofar as we can recon—
struct it now, he was a firm person and too forthright to have
lasted through 1937.

When Saburov begged that his life be spared—"not for me, but
for my little children"—Vlasov, out of vexation, pulled him back
by the jacket: "You‘re a fool."
