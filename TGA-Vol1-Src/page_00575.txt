The Slave Caravans

It was painful to travel in a Stolypin, unbearable in a Black
Maria, and the transit prison would soon wear you down—and
it might just be better to skip the whole lot and go straight to
camp in the red cattle cars.

As always, the interests of the state and the interests of the
individual coincided here. It was also to the state‘s advantage to
dispatch sentenced prisoners straight to the camps by direct
routing and thus avoid overloading the city trunk—line railroads,
automotive transport, and transit—camp personnel. They had long
since grasped this fact in Gulag, and it had been taken to heart:
witness the caravans of red cows (red cattle cars), the caravans
of barges, and, where there were no rails and no water, the cara—
vans on foot (after all, prisoners could not be allowed to exploit
the labor of horses and camels).

The red trains were always a help when the courts in some
particular place were working swiftly or the transit facilities were
overcrowded. It was possible in this way to dispatch a large
number of prisoners in one batch. That is how the millions of
peasants were transported in 1929—1931. That is how they exiled
Leningrad from Leningrad. That is how they populated the
Kolyma in the thirties: every day Moscow, the capital of our
country, belched out one such train to Sovetskaya Gavan, to
