because of "technical considerations." But, making up for this
lack, the accuser croons to us: "From beginning to end, it was
self—flagellation and repentance for the mistakes they committed.

completely justified that Marxist evaluation of the intelligentsia
made by the Bolsheviks.""

I don‘t know. Perhaps they did engage in self—flagellation.
Perhaps they didn‘t. Perhaps the passion to save one‘s life at any

Who was that young woman flashing past?

That was Tolstoi‘s daughter, Alexandra. Krylenko asked her:
"What did you do during these conversations?" And she an—

And who was that man over there? His face was familiar. It
was Savva Morozov. But listen here: after all, he gave the

such a well—nourished little imp that our Octobrist child—Law—
began to grow.

Today we don‘t remember this at all.
