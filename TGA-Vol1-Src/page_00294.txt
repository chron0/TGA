284 | THE GULAG ARCHIPEL AGO

As they used to joke in camp: "There is no court for nothing
—for that there is an OSO."

Of course, the OSO itself also needed for convenience some
kind of operational shorthand, but for that purpose it worked
out on its own a dozen "letter" articles which made operations
very much simpler. It wasn‘t necessary, when they were used, to
cudgel your brains trying to make things fit the formulations of
the Code. And they were few enough to be easily remembered by
a child. Some of them we have already described:

ASA —Anti—Soviet Agitation

KRD —Counter—Revolutionary Activity

KRTD—Counter—Revolutionary Trotskyite Activity (And that
"T" made the life of a zek in camp much harder.)

PSh _ —Suspicion of Espionage (Espionage that went beyond

SVPSh—Contacts Leading (!) to Suspicion of Espionage

KRM —Counter—Revolutionary Thought

VAS —Dissemination of Anti—Soviet Sentiments

SOE —Socially Dangerous Element

SVE —Socially Harmful Element

PD — ——Criminal Activity (a favorite accusation against
former camp inmates if there was nothing else to be
used against them)

ChS —Member of a Family (of a person convicted under
one of the foregoing "letter" categories)

It has to be remembered that these categories were not applied
uniformly and equally among different groups and in different

special decrees, they broke out in sudden epidemics.

There is one more qualification. The OSO did not claim to be
handing down a sentence. It did not sentence a person but, in—
stead, imposed an administrative penalty. And that was the whole
thing in a nutshell. Therefore it was, of course, natural for it to
have juridical independence!

But even though they did not claim that the administrative
