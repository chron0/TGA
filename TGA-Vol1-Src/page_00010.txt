Kil | PREFACE

And if freedom still does not dawn on my country for a long
time to come, then the very reading and handing on of this book
will be very dangerous, so that I am bound to salute future readers
as well—on behalf of those who have perished.

When I began to write this book in 1958, I knew of no memoirs
nor works of literature dealing with the camps. During my years
of work before 1967 I gradually became acquainted with the
Kolyma Stories of Varlam Shalamov and the memoirs of Dmitri
Vitkovsky, Y. Ginzburg, and O. Adamova—Sliozberg, to which
I refer in the course of my narrative as literary facts known to
all (as indeed they someday shall be).

Despite their intent and against their will, certain persons pro—
vided invaluable material for this book and helped preserve many
important facts and statistics as well as the very air they breathed:
M. I. Sudrabs—Latsis, N. V. Krylenko, the Chief State Prosecutor
for many years, his heir A. Y. Vyshinsky, and those jurists who
were his accomplices, among whom one must single out in par—
ticular I. L. Averbakh.

Material for this book was also provided by thirty—six Soviet
writers, headed by Maxim Gorky, authors of the disgraceful book
on the White Sea Canal, which was the first in Russian literature
to glorify slave labor.
