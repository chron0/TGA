schedule. Let the only perceptible result of the hunger strike be
the prisoner‘s exhaustion!

And that meant: If you want to kick the bucket, go ahead!

Arnold Rappoport had the misfortune to declare a hunger
strike in the Archangel NKVD Internal Prison at the very
moment when this directive arrived. It was a particularly severe
form of hunger strike, and that ought, it would seem, to have
given it more impact. His was a "dry" strike—without fluids—
and he kept it up for thirteen days. (Compare the five—day "dry"
strike of Dzerzhinsky, who probably wasn‘t isolated in a separate
cell. And who in the end won total victory.) And during those
thirteen days in solitary, to which Rappoport had been moved,
only a medical assistant looked in now and then. No doctor came.
And no one from the administration took the slightest interest
in what he was demanding with his hunger strike. They never
even asked him. The only attention the administration paid him
was to search his cell carefully, and they managed to dig out
some hidden makhorka and several matches. What Rappoport
wanted was to put an end to the interrogator‘s humiliation of him.
He had prepared for his hunger strike in a thoroughly scientific
way. He had received a food parcel earlier, and so he ate only
butter and ring—shaped rolls, baranki, and he quit eating black
bread a week before his strike. He starved until he could see the
light through his hands. He recalls experiencing a sensation of
lightheadedness and clarity of thought. At a certain moment, a
kindly, compassionate woman jailer named Marusya came to
his cell and whispered to him:; "Stop your hunger strike; it isn‘t
going to help; you‘ll just die! You should have done it a week
earlier." He listened to her and called off his hunger strike without
having gotten anywhere at all. Nevertheless, they gave him hot
red wine and a roll, and afterward the jailers took him back to the
common cell in a hand—carry. A few days later, his interrogation
began again. But the hunger strike had not been entirely useless:
the interrogator had come to understand that Rappoport had will
power enough and no fear of death, and he eased up on the
interrogation. "Well, now, it turns out you are quite a wolf," the
interrogator said to him. "A wolf!" Rappoport affirmed. "And
I‘ll certainly never be your dog."

Rappoport declared another hunger strike later on, at the
